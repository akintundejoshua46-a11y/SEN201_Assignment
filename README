SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC)

Project Title: Library Management System SDLC Model Used: Waterfall Model

Requirement Analysis
The requirement analysis phase focuses on identifying and documenting what the Library Management System is expected to do. This phase involves understanding the problems faced in manual library management and translating them into software requirements.

Problem Description

Manual library systems make it difficult to track books, monitor borrowing activities, and determine book availability. Records are often misplaced, leading to inefficiency and errors.

Functional Requirements

The system shall:

Allow the librarian to add new books to the library.

Display all books in the library.

Allow users to borrow books.

Allow users to return borrowed books.

Track the availability status of each book.

Non-Functional Requirements

The system shall:

Be easy to use and understand.

Be reliable and accurate.

Run on a computer system.

Respond quickly to user inputs.

System Design
In this phase, the system architecture and data structures were designed based on the identified requirements.

Architectural Design

The Library Management System is designed as a command-line application with three major modules:

Input Module: Accepts book details and user requests.

Processing Module: Handles borrowing and returning logic.

Output Module: Displays book records and availability status.

Data Design

Each book in the system is represented as a record containing:

Book Title

Author Name

Availability Status

These records are stored using a list of dictionaries.

Process Design

When a book is added, its availability status is set to Available.

When a book is borrowed, its availability status changes to Borrowed.

When a book is returned, its availability status is reset to Available.

Implementation
This phase involves translating the system design into executable code. The Library Management System was implemented using the Python programming language.

All variable names, functions, and terminologies used in the design phase (such as book, availability, borrow, and return) were maintained consistently in the code implementation.

The implementation provides functions for:

Adding books

Displaying books

Borrowing books

Returning books

Testing
The testing phase ensures that the system works as expected and meets all specified requirements.

Testing Strategy

Unit Testing: Individual functions such as add book, borrow book, and return book were tested independently.

Integration Testing: All modules were tested together to ensure smooth interaction.

System Testing: The complete system was tested with multiple book records.

Sample Test Case

Input: Borrow a book that is available Expected Output: Book availability changes to Borrowed Result: Test passed successfully

Deployment
After successful testing, the Library Management System was deployed as a Python-based command-line application. The system can be executed on any computer system with Python installed.

Deployment involves copying the source code to the target system and running the program using the Python interpreter.

Maintenance
The maintenance phase involves updating and improving the system after deployment.

Maintenance Activities

Fixing bugs discovered during usage.

Updating the system to support more features.

Improving system performance.

Enhancing user interface in future versions.

Conclusion

The Library Management System follows the complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using the Waterfall model. Each phase was carefully executed to ensure the development of a reliable and efficient software solution. The project successfully addresses the challenges of manual library management and demonstrates practical application of software engineering principles.
